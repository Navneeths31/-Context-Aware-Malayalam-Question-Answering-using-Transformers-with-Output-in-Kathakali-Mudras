# -Context-Aware-Malayalam-Question-Answering-using-Transformers-with-Output-in-Kathakali-Mudras

Kathakali is a dance drama, where a story is acted out using an exquisite and well-defined set of gestures and facial expressions. These 24 mudras can be combined with each other at different angles along with different facial expressions and different body postures to generate almost a thousand words. Malayalam has a rich morphology characterized by inflection and agglutination. mlmorph is a morphology analyser library in python for malayalam which can be used to generate root words. Models like ROBERTa, MuRIL, or mBERT support malayalam language and can be used for answer generation, given a context and a question.

A system to generate answers given a question and context in the Malayalam language is created first. Three transformer models (ROBERTa, MuRIL, and mBERT) are used and three metrics (Exact Match Accuracy, Jaccard similarity, and Cosine similarity) for each of the models, are used to evaluate their performances.  ROBERTa performed the best compared to the others. Thenwe use mlmorph library in python to analyze the generated answer from ROBERTa and give back the root words. The root words of the answers generated by ROBERTa are mapped to Kathakali mudras and displayed.
